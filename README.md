# epubTranslator

A simple terminal python script to translate epub file from English to Chinese. Use googleTrans package to implement the translation. This is just a script implement to deal with the reading homework in English class.

Note:  
1. This program may be buggy and won't translate as good as you wish  
4. DO NOT read input from the terminal. Any changes need to change the script  
2. As a hardcoded en-chs translator, it cannot be used simply in PRC as it use the google translate service  
3. Too many translate request may cause google to ban your ip from getting its translate service shortly, if this happened the program will prompt you to change your ip before go on.
